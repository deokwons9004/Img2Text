# Img2Text
A simple module for converting JPG & PNG to text.

By David Song (deokwons9004dev@gmail.com)

## Installation
If you don't want to download the entire repo, download package.json, img2text.js and use:

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Usage
In the directory of Img2Text:

```sh
$ node img2text.js <IMG_PATH> 
```

Unless Images are in the same directory, you must use absolute path.

The resulting text file will be created in the Img2Text Directory, and you need to reduce the font size to 1pt to see the final text representation of the image.
